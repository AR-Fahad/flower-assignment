            <h2>A flower is the bloom <span>or</span> blossom of a plant</h2>
            <article>A flower is the bloom or blossom of a plant. The flower is the part of a plant that produces seeds, which in time become other flowers. This is thanks to a process called pollination that is carried out either by insects or the wind. Every type of flower is different, in colour, smell, shape and size.</article>
